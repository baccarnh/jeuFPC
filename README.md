## circonstances to write this code:
  As exercise for the fourth week in a python cours and to apply diffrents theories teached, we have to carry out a first project.
  we have to code the fishumi game using functions and loops.

- The user lance the program and insert her name.
- He make choice from: pierre/feuille/ciseaux.
- The computer also make a random choice.
- Ones the two choices acheived, they will be compare to attribute marks according to the following rules:
