## Circonstances to write this code:

  As exercise for the fourth week in a python cours and to apply diffrents theories teached, we have to carry out a first project.
  We have to code the fishumi game using functions and loops.
  Every one should rely on my self to plannify my working time via Trello account and usecase plan.
  We had to be able to manage coding error and to provide users' mistakes.



## Fishumi game rules:

- The user lance the program and insert her name.
- He make choice from: pierre/feuille/ciseaux.
- The computer also make a random choice.
- Ones the two choices acheived, they will be compare to attribute marks according to the following rules:

      * pierre beats ciseaux
      * feuille beats pierre
      * ciseaux beats feuille.

If two choice are similar, no marks added for both.
the game is restarted until one of the player or the computer has three points.

## Goals acheived:

- Defining functions
- Using loops
- Using tuples, lists
- Provide user's errors
- Manage coding errors
- A good plan of time
- A respect of deadline and usecese steps
- calling a function from an other file
- calling a function in an other function
